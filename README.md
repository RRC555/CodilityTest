# CodilityTest

Here is the solution for the test provided. 

_Unfortunatily, Due to project restriction; I was forced not to configure the necessary plugins on my laptop to implement BDD. Hence I have used the available softwares to implement the same. I hope its acceptable._

Attached Results Screenhot and .XML log file for quick reference.

**Folder Structure**

> Config: Holds the Framework and test related configration.

> Data: Holds the testData for more test data definitly will rely on external application like MS-Excel

> PageObject: Holds the POM along with Object Repository; For time being all the methods are implemented in same file. But as per the standards, this will be part of framework(NuGet Packages)

> Steps: Actual test Scripts.

**Tools and plugins**

> Selenium With C#

> NUnit, please note:- No External reporting tool used. Have'nt said that 3rd party tool (like Extend Report) easily configured.

**Execution**

> Either from NUnit GUI or NUnit.Console runner testscripts can be triggered for execution.
